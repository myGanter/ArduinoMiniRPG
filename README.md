### Arduino MiniRPG

A retro-style game written for the Arduino platform.

Gameplay: you play as a hero whose goal is to go down into the dungeon as deep as possible, at each level you will be met by a portal that will take you to the level below. The lower, the more enemies. To counter them, the hero has several bombs that he can also find on the level.

The hero is controlled using a gyroscope, setting a bomb, using a button.
